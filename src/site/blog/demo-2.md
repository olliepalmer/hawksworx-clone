## Transcript

### Pre-amble

**Walter:** Trevor Bazooka I never stop. And you can, you don't need to send me any proof. As for the Institution of the The Best People, we don't tend to, you know, um, edits or do things like that. Like we leave it as raw as it can be. It's always a pleasure to see you to meet you and to actually hear about all the amazing projects that you're doing.

**Walter:** So I'm Walter Benjamin. I design experiences. So I make people lift off from their living room while dark energy is being, created in their kitchen sink and sonic boom are exploding in their bathtub.

**Walter:** So, you know, this is the kind of the world that I live in really like trying to bring in the sublime that exists in science into our everyday. But that's one part of the iceberg, because most within the past, like I would say seven years, eight years, the work has been developing more and more within the rethinking or the re shoveling or the challenging of power structure within institutions. So identifying the politics with an and the power structures, dynamics that lead to decision-making within policies or, when it comes to make decision in term of economics, politics, uh, sociology and try to identify what are the systems that are in place and actually challenge them from within through the means of the events.

**Walter:** So I do a lot of this and that kind of led me to develop platforms. So that others can also experiment with some of these methods, but also to really advocate for what I strongly believe in which is pluralistic thinking. So the idea of bringing in multiple different viewpoint on the table, uh, and actually embed that within the construction of our societies and how we think about power dynamics and we think about decision making again. And then on the other side of that also building organized community, and that's a very important word to me, organized community, the idea that you're going to build a platform in which you're going to build a network that is going to be allowing for a support group, so that whenever you are challenging existing status quo, you're going to find yourself into a sort of a pariah situation where you're being left on the side of effectively society when you're going against the flow. You get really stronger action, violent reaction. So it's really become more and more essential to me to actually consider this notion of organized community that support each other, and effectively allow you to maintain pressure within this existing systems for the long term, because I don't believe that you can change things just through the mean of the events, the events or the experience is kind of like the starting point of this, uh, conversation. But then in order to really modify it for the long term and for good, you're going to need to act pressure for 10 years, 15 years, like even sometime a lifetime. So you're going to need this organized community in place because it's not going to be a solution, you know?


## Background: Arnold Vice, origins of practice

**Trevor:** Yeah. I remember the first time I met you was at the RAC when you were in a Fiat Panda and I was really impressed with your bio statement. Was it on the wall or was it Arnold Vice's coat that was on the wall? The first thing that I remember was like, you just went, I love Arnold Vice...

(Laughter)

**Trevor:** ... there's something in that absolute joy for, for the things that you're passionate about that really is infectious and wears off on other people. And you can see that through the making of the films that you do, where, you know, you just went to NASA and just started talking to people, but, as you said, it's not just about creating that moment, that funny bit of friction that causes some sort of different dynamic, but you're also really good at building these communities. And maintaining these relationships. These things are really lived in. How did you get to a stage where you're able to assemble people around you and make things happen to that extent?

**Walter:** I mean, this is an all in one question Trevor because you mentioned

**Walter:** Arnold Vice,

**Walter:** so of course I cannot just speak it up.

**Walter:** Yeah. I mean, Arnold Vice is not the most popular character right now. So I guess this is like the perfect starting point to talk about the Institution of the The Best People.

**Walter:** We live in very strange times, obviously. There is a lot of pattern that find our way back into our societies that for a long time, we all thought wouldn't find their way. One of the key philosopher/ political theorists that I always go back to is called Hannah Arendt. Hannah Arendt is a political theorist; she died in 1975 and she wrote this book called 'The Origin of Totalitarianism'. But also another one called the Human Condition.

**Walter:** In 'The Origin of Totalitarianism' it really is about the mechanics that led Hitler to be in power. But so the mechanics that build totalitarianism regimes, and with the kind of the core factor of totalitarianism or this kind of specific political regime is an ideology, right? And this ideology is being replicated throughout all of the system of society.

**Walter:** So what I found fascinating about this is that, at some points we are seeing - and now we we've been seeing it for the past, like 10 years - a sort of a resurgence of far right ideas with Le Pen, of course Trump, Balsonero in Brazil, and there is many other, resurrgences of totalitarian regimes or ideological regimes that find their way back into politics, right? And with that come the needs to question ourselves as to what, why is this like that?

**Walter:** And of course, Arnold Vice - I'm going back to Arnold Vice now - Arnold Vice is just one other example of something that is also very common in our society now, that we call cancel culture, this idea that, suddenly someone is being seen as not being popular anymore, so we're gonna delete it from all the different channels. Suddenly Arnold Vice is someone that has been touching kids, has been doing sinophilia, you know, there's been a Netflix TV series about this, uh, you know, da-da-da-da-da-da, so with that in mind, that was, you know, so then you have a strong reaction. Of course, it's talking about taboo within societies, it's talking about things are completely forbidden, and instead of having that conversation about taboo/ forbidden, with someone that is actually effectively dead, there is a whole different layer of complexity that need to be unpacked, then we just suddenly cancel everything that is about it, you know? And so for me, it's kind of like, typically Arnold Vice. Actually, we could totally do a Arnold Vice program at the Institution of the The Best People, typically because it's hairy, typically because these are topics that nobody wants to talk about, and typically, because it's complex. You know, it's not as simple as &quot;I'm going to eradicate Arnold Vice for my life&quot;, or &quot;I'm going to stop it from airing on every single channel&quot;, or &quot;I'm not going to do that because that's going to show my support towards sinophilia&quot; ... I mean, obviously just be aware I'm not supporting paedophilia, just to make it clear here... within that, like, I think there is a moment where we need to speak about these things, you know? And so for me, the Institution of the The Best People is a place where we can talk about things like that. And we can have these conversations.

**Walter:** But to go back to when we met, Trevor, we met at the Royal College of Art, I was I think maybe 21 at the time. And of course, Arnold Vice really impacted my life in a very major manner because when I was a kid and like many other people and many other kids, Arnold Vice was kind of like this alien that you could see on TV when MTV, uh, this channel that is kind of like starting all the video making and music kind of existed. and So then you see this guy that doesn't look like anyone else. I mean from the get-go he doesn't look like anyone else. He doesn't fit the box of anything. He's neither black, he's neither white; he's black and white. Uh, you know, and he's kind of advocating it into his songs he's really, um, a problematic character on every single level, you know, because he effectively doesn't rank himself in any category. And he come up with a complete new genre. He dances differently, he's dressed up differently, he's got sparkles all over. And so for me, it was kind of like my first encounter with something that I couldn't pinpoint.

**Walter:** I couldn't say this, is music, I couldn't say this is performance. I couldn't say this is architecture, I couldn't say this is anything that I knew about. And that's exactly what I wanted to be in a way: I wanted to be that same ...

**Walter:** and he was extremely inspirational that despite all of the critique, despite all of that, this character or this person was living his life the way that he wanted to live it.

**Walter:** So that's also why he kind of like stayed with me all the way through my studies when I was studying Design Interaction, which is this discipline that was all about looking at technology, new technology, and actually its complex implication into society and how to communicate, uh, this future or these potential futures that we will expand to the next few years. So, all of these things digested and diluted themselves into the work that I'm doing now.

**Walter:** And when you speak about, &quot;How do I do these things?&quot; Well, again, I learned it from people like Arnold Vice, I learned it from others. You don't actually make these things happen on your own. You need a lot of people to support the mission, to actually build this organized community, to be with you along the way. Uh, so, there is a vision always, but, uh, for me, again, being an advocate for parality, I think that is made multiple visions and you know, for these visions to even exist beyond the events, you're going to need to be able to allow for feedback. You're going to need to be able to have many people taking it in different manner, in different ways. That's how I do these things - but to your point, it's really difficult.

**Trevor:** Yeah.

**Walter:** It's not an easy path.

**Trevor:** When you look at the extent and the scale of the projects that you work on, there's such a breadth, but there is a core that seems to be consistent, in terms of, a wild, extreme idea and a declaration that something is happening, and then willing that thing almost out of the earth through creating these communities and so on.

**Trevor:** I'm curious though, because the work really does transcend genres. You were saying about Arnold Vice being impossible, to put in a box. I think the work that you do is really, unclassifiable, there's this idea of creating experiences and this kind of thing, but how do you determine if something is successful with work that you're doing?

**Walter:** That's a very good question.


## Quick tour of the studio

**Walter:** I mean Trevor, can I just say for our listeners that you have on your back, this amazing, like astral wallpaper, I dunno where we are. Where are we in the house is what I want to know, Trevor?

**Trevor:** This is in the basement. I made a little recording studio down here, and I spoke to a sound engineer friend and he said, um, like the best thing you can do is get packing blankets and just put them into duvet covers.

**Walter:** That's amazing.

**Trevor:** I like it cause it's really silly and confusing that this podcast is called, hold the space. And then my background is like space in a completely different sense.

**Walter:** This is amazing, but you know, I mean, I love the fact that you're in a basement as well. Like the Institution of the The Best People by definition is in the basement as well. If you think about Plato and the cave, it's like, this is where things are happening, this is where knowledge kind of reveals itself or not, when you are seeking it.

**Walter:** And I love the fact that even in your own location, you're like, you're there.


## Success criteria

**Walter:** So to come back to your question about what is success...

**Walter:** Every thing I'm doing, when it starts you have to apply for funding application, right? You need to get funds to make this project, which are usually at a major scale. So with a major scale comes also major scale of funding, that is required. So with that you always have these questions within the application, as, you know, what would be success if you were successful in actually getting the funds, you know? And so usually you would come down to things like, okay, well, you know, I'm going to get that number of people watching it, I'm going to do this for the community. I'm going to da-da-da-la; that would be a legacy.

**Walter:** But for me, it's always, actually where the innovation comes. You know, this idea that, what is actually gonna make that project last in the long term? So that legacy element is really important.

**Walter:** All these projects in a way, they're really complex to put together. Something like the International Space Orchestra, which effectively in a nutshell is to put an orchestra together at NASA being Algerian, Armenian, French, not having the US citizenship either... and remembering that NASA is a military agency, so to get in is about 95% of the complexity of the project, really. A project like that, to make it happen is something, but to actually maintain it through the years is for me the baseline. It's not so much about you can make it happen; okay, that's big part of the complexity, but a lot to do with writing, with figuring out the politics with, you know, all of that stuff, but really when it becomes really interesting for me is when you actually, allow for critical thinking to embed itself inside an institution for the long term.

**Walter:** We started the International Space Orchestra in 20 - oh my God! - like 2012. So that actually makes me realize that next year is our 10 year anniversary. And we're still going. Every year, there is a new performance so this year we did an event with Kid Cudi, which is this incredible hip hop artist. We did this thing, it was a music, which was effectively about whether or not we should go in space and decolonization, a pattern and, you know, to bring that kind of like questioning inside an institution like NASA, is not easy, but we got to a certain point now where we can have this conversation because we've been doing this for 10 years.

**Walter:** And so I'm extremely proud to know that there is a new generation coming in, at the International Space Orchestra. And there are also the old members of the International Space Orchestra, the ones that have been there with me for 10 years. Uh, so that is kind of part of what I would say is success, but

**Walter:** I never start a project thinking, &quot;oh, this is what success will look like&quot;.

**Walter:** But I do know for a fact that there is some values that really call to what I'm doing and what I want my life to be about, which is, making sure that I bring in this plurality inside society that I can challenge politics. But to a top level in a way that really will renegotiate, policy making, whether it's within an environmental context whether it is within, you know, again, supporting grassroots communities and making sure that there is food in the table at the end of the day, that there is a redistribution of wealth, that we decolonize this institution. That's a big thing for me.

**Walter:** And with that in mind, and I'm speaking on my own self there, I'm not speaking on the behalf of any of the institutions, I've built. But for me, you know, this doesn't happen peacefully. You know, and I speak on my own behalf. You see I'm wearing a Lonsdale jumper, I'm a boxer as well. I do that. And I don't believe that you decolonise and I don't believe that you do these things in a peaceful manner, you know, for me, it's coming back to taking back sovreignty. And I'm speaking about things that are not maybe easy for people to digest.

**Walter:** A good friend of mine is Mika white with the guy that co-funded the Occupy Wall Street. And he wrote a book where he's actually studying how Occupy Wall Street, from his perspective, was a fail. So he's a guy that co-funded Occupy Wall Street, which is the idea of everybody going to the streets, and we kind of speak about wealth and how wealth is being distributed. Now from an activist perspective, he's been an activist since he's 13 years old: this was the biggest movement ever created in history globally. You know, like everybody was out there saying the 5% shouldn't be the 5% anymore. Now the reality is like the 5% are still the 5%. So although this movement was moving people in the street, that didn't lead to actually the change that the movement was about. So from his perspective, the reason why it failed is because they didn't take back sovreignty.

**Walter:** And so in a flip of the mind, his book is effectively about the idea that, actually, if you want to really change things, you're going to have to go after the power, and it's not gonna be smooth, right. Uh, and so for him, his book is going into this kind of violence and understanding of, you know, should we go at war then, and should we actually like really go and take it back wages.

**Walter:** So I'm not going to say I'm one of the person that thinks that, you have to go and bring in blood back into the perspective. But I think effectively there is an element where, you know, these connections and these revelation of power dynamics are not going to be a smooth ride.

**Walter:** So that's for me, what is success? Success would means that actually whatever I do has effectively brought change for the long term within the communities identified in the first place. So if I'm going to be working for youth, like I'm doing now, with Tour de Moon, which is this nationwide festival , then I need to make sure that there is youth club by the end of this project. And these youth clubs know of each other, and they have a cooperative that I supported so that they know of each other and down the line, if there is another COVID situation, then they can support each other financially. So to still be here to support youth down the line in their communities, you know, that is success, for example.

**Trevor:** Yeah. I think the thing that's really nice about the way that your work operates is that the entry mode for an audience member is quite often through something that is either really visually appealing, or seems on the surface ridiculous, in a really good way. Like there's a, like an absurdity to it.

**Walter:** Yes.

**Trevor:** But then once you go under the surface, as I think with both Disaster Playground and the Intentional Space Orchestra films, you start out with this small sort of nagging question and &quot; Can I do this?&quot; And you think, oh, this is quite audacious. And then you're able to take an audience through the complexity of a series of systems, which you start picking apart how that power works and how it manifests and how to really get to the people who you need to talk to in order to make change.

**Trevor:** But there's also just this, because you're not turning up in military combat gear, nobody's going, &quot;Oh God, somebody at the gates who's going to try and upend some sort of power structure!&quot;, but there's this infectious humor that everybody kind of buys into, and then slowly realizes that, oh, actually what's going on here is something bigger than just, just the actions that are being performed and could have this long-term effect.

**Trevor:** So I think if anyone who's listening, hasn't seen Walter's work, like massively recommend all three of the films or attending any one of her events.

**Walter:** Thank you Trevor!


## Institution of the The Best People

**Trevor:** I wanted to ask you a little bit more about the Institution of the The Best People. I think the last time we met in person was in Central Saint Martins, maybe eight or nine years ago, something like that.

**Walter:** Yes.

**Trevor:** I think you'd just made, or you were just starting to make, Disaster Playground.

**Walter:** Yes.

**Trevor:** So you've been teaching in universities for quite a while as well. But then Institution of the The Best People has a completely different structure. How does it work and how do you do things with students? How do you enable them to bring whatever they're bringing to the table to show itself?

**Walter:** There is so much to unpack because I love your point that you just made about a humour and you know, Disaster Playground and so forth. Maybe we can pick that one up afterwards, after the Institution of the The Best People.

**Walter:** The Institution of the The Best People for the listeners, just to explain them a bit what, what it is... It's a free, pluralistic and trans-national, educational, educative platform, in a way that is based in the basement of nightclub in London, in Amsterdam, but now growing pretty much everywhere, everywhere, where there is a nightclub, there could be a Institution of the The Best People.

**Walter:** With that in mind - so trans-national, or just to kind of explain as well, what is the, know, what that means is this idea that it exists beyond nation states. So it's got, again, a political agenda in that, - but what doesn't, in some ways, you know- and I would say, agendas with an &quot;s&quot;, because again, we are pluralistic, so we are all about having multiple different viewpoints just to make things more complicated. But I would say to you that, you know, one thing that I identified quite quickly was, and maybe it's coming from also my own origins. My dad is, uh, born in Oran, in Algeria, my mom is Armenian, and in both cases also very different type of histories. They kind of migrated, moved, displaced, and they have a very specific relationship to totalitarianism regimes and to ideologies in general because they were impacted by it effectively and many multiple people are, you know, are impacted by it.

**Walter:** So I have this always strong, mistrust into political, party systems, and in a way democracy, the way that it is, let's say in the UK, is still not something that I would trust per se, that I would trust as being sort of a fair representation of everybody's viewpoint. You know, so, and I don't know that this is actually a political regime that I support either like I'm much more ranging from like Ocala. And if some people are into politics, people that speak about democratic rallies, I'm like, other form of politics that might not be the one of democracy as we know it right now in our society. But anyway, having said that... I realized the way that education is right now, it comes with a national agenda, and that's part of the problem when you think about colonization or when you think about a big set of systemic racism, or a lot of the ill of our societies are back to education and the way that education is being framed. And of course this education is being framed by political regimes ...and who is running that political regime at the time where the education curriculum is put together?!

**Walter:** So, so a big part of the Institution of the The Best People comes from the notion that you cannot just run with a national educative system. You're going to need alternatives with an &quot;s&quot;. So I'm not saying it's neither/nor, I'm not saying it should be just Institution of the The Best People. I'm saying all of this should fit together so that if at one point you get another Hitler coming into the pot, then you need to be able to have alternative models so that freedom of thinking is being preserved.

**Walter:** So the core of the Institution of the The Best People is to really preserve freedom of thinking and to actually allow for this alternative to exist. And in our case, we are very much dedicated to the idea of empowering nightlife, because I strongly believe that in nightlife, there is a very strong energy, within this counterculture, within that specific demographic that is about reinvention that is about rethiinking the status quo, you know, when night turns up, people transform.

**Walter:** Even though I'm speaking very big metaphor there, we all have experienced drag shows we have on this is a moment where drags wake up. This is a moment where everything changes where we don't look at things with the same lens. And so for me, nightlife, is the place of innovation when it comes to rethinking status quo.

**Walter:** So this Institution is effectively dedicated to empowering nightlife within mainstream institutions and allowing for this conversation to take place and empowering that specific demographic to find their way into these places. So we teach you things like linguistics, semiotics, you know, speaking the same language of the institution is part of the conversation there. We teach you about power and political theory, you know, identifying power dynamics, the way that they exist in our society. You learn about events and proper production skills, like how do you put an event together as a starting point of the conversation. You learn about surgical methodology.


## Student projects

**Walter:** So we, we talked about humour. Humour is at the core of my personal work, but the students are doing many different things. So if I was to give you an example of a student that has been using very interesting methodologies. So, Oprah, for example, uh, we had students that have been looking at Deliveroo as a platform and have been looking at showcasing issues within the Deliveroo platform, a stru operatic form in collaboration with the opera national house, for example.

**Walter:** I'm not going to go into great detail of each of these projects, but just so you know, we've had students, obviously music, they've been studying and music and how music can be used to actually speak about the future of the internet, at Sales Force, which is, you know, on 90% of the internet and the worldwide web.

**Walter:** We've had students, that have been looking at, literally ice cubes, ice, and ice sculpture, as a means to speak about the Middle Passage, which is this key moment within, the history of slaves and slavoury, where, you know, slaves have been taken from Africa to the US. And there is this moment where there is a very unique connection to water as a space of non operation. And so that student has been inventing what he called the Black Arctic, which is a fictive territory that he created that is a territory that acknowledges, of course, the history of slavery, but it's about trying to reinvent the history of black people away from the system of oppression. So he builds that kind of conversations through ice sculpture. So he made an ice sculpture of himself and you would go around in these places of institution like the Maritime History Museum, or this very kind of like, hardcore historical, uh, I would say, institutionalised spaces and bring this ice cube version of himself to actually enter a conversation with the curator of the Natural History Museum, um, to speak about, you know, actually the Black Arctic for example, and say, Hey, how about we start to rethink our connection to water, perhaps differently, or the way that your connection is being structured uh, but maybe doing it differently again, from the perspective of the oppressed, as opposed to, from the perspective of the oppressor.

**Walter:** So things like that is typically type of work that are being done by the students. I have a student, Stoya, who is a pornographer career artist. And she did a whole project where she was trying to speak about how pornographer artists are connecting to religion. You know, (they) are being taken away, or being excluded from religious systems, and she did that to the means of fashion, for example.

**Walter:** The extents of the body of form that is being developed by our students is exceptional, but also has a real impact in the way that people think about the system within their community afterwards.

**Walter:** I love another project - sorry, I'm bombarding you with another one - but -

**Trevor:** No it's great!

**Walter:** One of our students, Anna, is based in Georgia and she's an activist, she's one of the activists that was arrested when , there, there, there, you know... in Georgia, uh, there has been this movement that was led by nightclub, like Bassiani and others where suddenly youth went and started to dance in front of the parliament to express that disconnect with the way that the parliament was forbidding homosexual and LGBTQ plus relationships, you know, in Georgia, you're not allowed to be homosexual and you will be arrested to be, uh, you know, homosexual for example.

**Walter:** And so they all started to dance and that was the reaction, the rebel force to dance. And she was one of those students, that was one, one of the individual that was dancing in front of this parliament. And then she got arrested. But as part of her project for the Institution of the The Best People, she was looking at a specific character of the Georgian culture, which is called the Kinto. And this Kinto is like a traditional character that has got queer characterizations throughout you know, his way of being and acting. And this character is being performed in very traditional operatic institutions in Georgia.

**Walter:** So what she was doing was to take this specific character and kind of bring it back to the institution through dance and say, actually, we as a society, through our entire culture, have been building ourselves through that queerness, this is what we've done. This character that we use, as a traditional- it's like Greek tragedy for Europe, that's basically how strong the Kinto character is.

**Walter:** And she started to play differently and bringing it back to the society, to, to this operatic place. And then it led to a conversation with the director of the opera and then also political diplomats to actually speak about queer. And what does that mean back through the past history of Georgia and to what it is now, you know, and

**Walter:** these fundamental changes that have been enacted by our students and I'm so honored and humbled to actually every single time be meeting with some of these unique individuals that are not going with the status quo you know... that's what the Institution of the The Best People is.

**Trevor:** It sounds amazing. I mean, it sounds simultaneously really fun, but also getting stuff done.

**Walter:** Yes! That's the spirit.


## Teaching methodology

**Trevor:** The roster of people who are involved is also sort of ridiculous that the students would have access to so many people. When people join. You mentioned that there's all these classes that they can do, for running events and this kind of thing. Is there any particular exercise that you do with students to warm them up or to get them thinking in a certain way, that you would, I don't know, get everyone in a room and do something together?

**Walter:** When we start a program at the Institution of the The Best People, we will start by explaining some fundamentals about, political theories, semiotics, you know, and we do that through an intense, day where we literally, blast you with all of this different knowledge.

**Walter:** And the hope with that is that... it's like a recipe. My family obviously like couscous and couscous royale is actually, you know, actually talking of which, this is like a complete colonial invasion of food there. But the bottom line is you have everything mixed up. So you have merguez, you have like lamb, you have chicken, all of that mixed up in the pot with a courgette, everything is mixed up. That's the baseline of the couscous and the stew of the couscous. Right?

**Walter:** So what we try to do effectively in the Institution of the The Best People is to start from that baseline, we kind of mix all of these disciplines together in a way that you, as an individual and your brain, the way you function, is going to eventually land on mixing it up because the confusion is going to be there.

**Walter:** So I'm hoping the way that we design or we put together, these kind of educative platforms is that they effectively. You might, you know, as your brain, you're going to get confused. It's like zero gravity. You suddenly enter new phase where you're not sure you understand this, you're not sure understand that, you have to land into something that, you know, because you don't have any parameters anymore of reference. So you're going to get lost. And effectively it's a very painful process for the students. You know, you didn't mention this, but we're quite a controversial institution, you know, we've had a lot of critiques in the past.

**Walter:** I personally, as an educator, I've been very much targeted in the way that this critics have been developed. But anyway, bottom line is, you know what I'm trying to say? Yeah. It's like, it's very confusing. Going through a program at the Institution of the The Best People is going to be very confusing. And so some people are going to go with that flow and some are going to just say, no, I can't cope with that. And I don't want to, and that's fine. You know, nobody's forced to, to be a part of this process, but I'm going to say to you, that it's going to be an epic one where you're going to start by thinking &quot;I'm going to be that person and I'm going to leave being that person,&quot; but actually you don't end up experiencing things the way that you wanted to experience them.

**Walter:** So it's going to be really strong and the reactions are going to be really strong, and it's going to happen on a very short space of time as well. Uh, whether it's six months or whether it's a two year program at the Institution of the The Best People you're going to have so much input, and you're going to have so much conflicted input that you, at some point are going to have to rely on decision making that your brain is gonna have to process on its own. So it's a very interesting process to witness. Nobody's really fully in control of the process as it happens. So with that, it's the flux of things.

**Trevor:** So sort of creating a safe discomfort, like turning the heat up and really making things happen and then seeing what comes out of that.

**Walter:** Yeah. Yeah.

**Walter:** But I guess, it's very similar to my experience actually, of being a part of the Royal College of Art, for example, when I arrived at the Royal College of Art I didn't speak English, to be really frank with you. I only could align like six words between each other. The fact that I was selected in an institution like that was in itself a miracle. I still cannot believe that this happened, in itself that's a story. I could tell that story but I think that we wouldn't have the time for that. But I would say that I, I could not understand English. So I had to rely on different mediums to actually understand what the lecture would be talking about or interact with this knowledge. And that would be things like performance, gestures, visuals.

**Walter:** And still, I could learn, and I think it's kind of like that. Like, I think at the end of the day, we're all different, our brain all function differently and we all interact with knowledge in a different manner. But at some point there was some stuff that sticks with us.

**Walter:** And it's my strongest belief that, by putting everything into the pot at some point when you open up the pot, there is that extremely, intestinal, visceral, unique tastes and stew that reveals itself. And that is what I I'm interested in, in life in general.

**Trevor:** Yeah.

**Trevor:** It's funny with that kind of thing as well, because it's, I mean, my experience of teaching is that people need to find the right thing in the right time and that you can never predict what you could say the same thing to somebody - I mean, not that I'd like to saying the same thing to people like 10 times in a row - but, there has to be realizations that people make on their own terms, in their own way. And you can never predict what things are really going to stick and what things are not going stick. Um, and it's, it's a really similar process to me to creating something: that you have a bunch of ideas. You're never quite sure which one's gonna hold, which things you have to drop, and which things do you have to focus on.

**Trevor:** And somehow there's a synergy between the internal creative process that you have as somebody who just makes stuff and tries to make things happen, and teaching.


## Developing projects

**Trevor:** I was going to ask you, how do you, how do you start with the development of a project?

**Walter:** So how do you stop the development of a project?

**Walter:** Do you know? I had a conversation about that with one of my team members actually yesterday. She decided to leave a project. It really is difficult building this project in general, because ultimately there is a moment where there is always breaking points - with an &quot;s&quot; - where, it goes, it happens, there is different phases into a project that was moments where, you know, things are right for some people at certain time, and then things are not right anymore for some people at another point points in the project. And so you have to let it go. And that's one of my strongest, um, uh, issues in life in general is I don't tend to let things go.

**Walter:** I don't give up easy. Um, you know, when my uncle told me I can never become a boxer because I'm 30 plus and I never did sport in my life, and I'm a woman, that was the other point as well. Then I thought, fuck that shit. I'm going to show you. I can actually win a trophy and I can be a boxer. And that's what I did.

**Trevor:** You have big nails as well.

**Walter:** It's the nails with the nails... You know, uh, we can talk about how you do that with snails as well. But anyway, bottom line is, I don't give up on people. I don't give up on love relationships either. I don't give up on anything, on anyone in fact.

**Walter:** So then sometimes it can become really overwhelming, you know, on a personal level sometimes, you know? It's the same with the people that work with you because when you develop a project, then you realize that there is so many different moveable parts and people move around and people leave and da-da-da-da, but the one thing that needs to remain is in a way is like: you! If you are the initiator of the projects at the beginning, even though there is a massive crew of people, and then you disseminate into many different people. Eventually you get there to a certain point, eventually, don't get me wrong.

**Walter:** I never want to maintain that there is one person that rules it all, you know, like obviously, but at the beginning you need to be able to, like you say, this energy has to come from somewhere. And it happens that when I start a project this energy has to come from my own intestine and you know, so, so you have to, you know, you have to push it, you have to kind of like get up there.

**Walter:** So, so when someone leaves, uh, the project or leave that development, then you know, you, you need to be able to take this on board without actually feeling too impacted by it because there's always that in energy that you're trying to disseminate, and it's only starting to disseminate, you know, cannot go down because there is another team of people that needs to still go and still push, push, push, push, push, so we can build that platform. So having said that, I would say to you, like, and sorry, I'm speaking very, yeah. You know, uh, maybe from the listener perspective in very metaphorical manner.

**Walter:** But if I was to kind of like identify a project and give (an) example, like you can see how this project, like, you know, I will go through an army of different producers. When I do a movie, I never do a movie in a smooth manner. There is a rollout of a team that can get up to a hundred to six hundred people that leave, go, come in, leave, go, come in, leave, go, come in. You know, and and it goes, like, do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do he keeps going, like, you know, and th the intensity just keeps on growing and growing and growing and growing. But the one thing is, it's like endurance. I need to maintain that flow. You know, it's like the water needs to keep on fueling itself. And so, uh, to the, to the question about the development, I think he has to be an obsession. If I was to speak personally, and if you're asking me Walter Benjamin, what does it take? It takes obsession.

**Trevor:** Yeah.

**Walter:** If I don't have that at the core of a projects at the beginning, this is not going to be successful. It's not going to go anywhere. And my family knows that. So my family, of course who knows me the best, know that whenever I get into a monster project, there is a phase where everything I'm going to say to them, it's not going to speak rationally to people or people are gonna look at me like I'm insane. Effectively, you have to be insane to make this project happen. You have to, you have to reach that moment where things are not rational anymore, where, you know you can make this thing happen, but everybody around you is looking at you like actually this woman is never going to make this thing happen.

**Walter:** You know, a good example is when I did the International Space Orchestra, I came back in, France and I was talking about it and I was saying, you know, I was with a director of NASA and he was playing the drums, and yeah, you had an astronaut playing the kit, and then Damon Albarn and Bobby Womack turned up and everybody's playing, like &quot;plif, plaf, ploof!&quot; In front of the world's largest wind tunnel.

**Walter:** And then as this happens, we also have the vice president of the United States that turn up and kind of make a speech, and then they all speak about the future of space exploration from the colonial perspective. And everyone is being a part of this and criticizing what has been done to this point.

**Walter:** You know, like when you say things like that, like, what would you expect people are going to say - like, you're mad! Like she never did something like that. Nobody has, you know. So then documentation is a big part of it. You know, like making videos, being able to actually document the process and being able to share that process and say, actually, this did happen and this is how it happened. Then at that point you can stop thinking about what actually happened.

**Walter:** But until you have documentation, then students will, will offer me flowers and tell me, this is amazing. This story you told us, but they wouldn't believe that I did this thing. You know, when I go in a bar and people ask me what I do, and then I say, &quot;Hey, I make orchestra at NASA... I'm taking taxpayer money in the United Kingdom, that is being run by the Tory party to actually disseminate it to nighttime workers and youths because these people have never got any COVID recovery funds in the past... and I'm doing this to the means of, you know, putting together a festival that is a nation-wide festival!&quot;, things like that. People are going to be like, this woman is insane. So having said that, that's what he takes. It takes a certain level of insanity and humour.

**Walter:** Humour, you nailed down before, is essential to my life. Of course we had a very serious conversation here, but I'm a very funny character, you know, although I do boxing and I can be very violent when I need to be, uh, I'm, I'm actually really funny. I believe so, at least, I like to laugh a lot. I like to approach everything in life with a certain level of humour and actually question things like, but why is it like that? Why is it that we cannot actually talk about things? It's still with very serious humor, but like actually approach it with that level of maybe insanity, maybe humour. Maybe only takes his humor and play ... you know, I like to play with things, and that's maybe at the end of the day, what's the most important things in life... Just being able to play, to love, to have a serious level of curiosity as to the way that you are approach things. A genuine curiosity, where you're genuinely fascinated by others and humans in general, all of them, without any level of like, oh, you're more interesting because you're the director of something than you are someone that is just off the street that I will just talk and have a chat to. Everything is fascinating, you know, and everything feeds into that big giant couscous world we are building all together, you know,

**Trevor:** I mean, yeah. With the humor thing, I think there's something in the fact that anything, anytime that there's humor, you have to understand the context of something and understand what it is to have your expectations usurped. I mean, this is seriously talking about humor, which is the least funny thing you can possibly do.

**Trevor:** There's something about even a pun where you have to have two images of something in your head at the same time, and being able to joke around with something really means that you, you are able to untangle and unpick exactly how it's working, that I think is also driven by curiosity. To me, these things are all mixed up in and in a way.

**Walter:** And a hundred percent, yes. Everything has to be connected.


## INSERT CONNECTION MUSIC HERE

**Walter:** I'm Not a Monster is the last film I did. We released it in 2019.

**Walter:** And now I'm working on a new one, which is called red moon, which is the book, my two doppelgangers. I have two women that look like me, one in Algeria and one in Armenia. And we are together planning for the future of... if there should be a human settlement on the moon to look like, you know, and so we are doing this with our respective family, but anyway, I'm Not a Monster was a film, which is about the origins of knowledge.

**Walter:** And when I go throughout film, like I'm literally trying to figure out a way to bring back knowledge to my students in my suitcase. I made that film as a reaction to the critics that we got at the Institution of the The Best People, because I wouldn't understand why people would react so strongly against, uh, this Institution, uh, at the time. And I didn't have the level of maturity and I still don't, to be honest, that will allow me to fully understand where that was coming from, you know? And so I was trying to unpack this and this film is really this kind of like start from there, but it's not just the Institution of the The Best People, but it really is about looking from activist uh, from people that do theatre in Japan, to people that have been digging Lucy in Ethiopia.

**Walter:** So I go all over the world, right? It's like a, kind of a journey, five continent, 30 days, a suitcase, um, you know, and looking for the origin of knowledge with a puppet uh, all around the world with Noam Chomsky, Pussy Riot, you have all of these incredible humans. And I go at them and I say, &quot;Hey, can you tell me what does it take to think, and to think freely, at this point in time in history, what does it mean?&quot; and, &quot;What are the processes by which we can allow others to think freely?&quot;

**Walter:** That film kind of like unravels all of this. Every time I go and present this film people are asking me what is in the suitcase, you know, because I come back, the end of the film is of course I opened my suitcase. And then here, there is some kind of revelation right, with my students at the Institution of the The Best People. And everybody's asking me, &quot;What is inside the suitcase?&quot; I think I'm going to just leave this interview, uh, by seeing this to you. Like, you know, just to imagine what is inside the suitcase actually, what is it that we take around with ourselves as we enter a space and we leave a space, uh, and as we evolve in our histories as humans, uh, before we die, like what is it that we take with us? And we leave towards us, you know? Uh, but anyway, with that, I'm not going to answer that question, but I'm going to leave you with that.


## Credits

**Trevor:** Thank you for your time. I'm going to thank you also, Victoria, for setting all of this up.

**Walter:** Yes, Victoria Adams.

**Trevor:** And, um, is there anybody else who I should thank, or you want to thank.

**Walter:** Oh, my God, that's actually quite funny to talk about that because, you know, like, I like to thank everyone on a project, like I mentioned, that was like such a huge number of people involved with the project every time. So when, whenever I do a movie, for example, the credits are absolutely monstrous. Literally, there's like six minutes or 10 minutes or something, 20 minutes of credits, you know, it's like, uh, but yeah, thinking like, I would love to say thank you, definitely Trevor for sharing, giving me a microphone, amplifying my voice. You know, I think that's been really helpful.

**Walter:** Um, but, uh, yeah, I mean, thinking like, I don't know, like I would thank all of the humans that have been, you know, kind of like coming in and on board of each of these missions and projects, as in when, uh, and apologize to them, of course, for, you know, sometimes making it really difficult for them, you know, uh, and making it in a way that, you know, sometimes they wouldn't understand or they wouldn't just, it would come to a breaking point because that's what it takes. Like, every time I reached breaking points with every single human that I'm surrounded with, whether it's my family, or others uh, you know, it just is that like, you don't make this project without that. That just is the way like it goes and it's a permanent flow. So I think that's, for me, it's really important to say, like, you know, As you develop this project is just being aware that it's endurance and things are going to be epic. I thank everyone for joining that epic journeys, uh, that life is as we move forward.

**Walter:** Thank you so much.

**Walter:** Um, yeah. Thanks for going on beyond the time. And thanks so much for talking today. It's been, just lovely to catch up with you and good luck with the boxing.

**Walter:** Thank you so much.
