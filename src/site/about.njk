## About the podcast

Each episode features a conversation with a creative practitioner who teaches. Guests can include artists, designers, architects, musicians - anybody who works in a creative field, but also teaches. The podcast aims to interrogate the relationship between creative practice and teaching. It is interested in a few main themes:



* What do you do?
* How do you do it?
* What do you teach?
* How do you teach it?
* How did you get to where you are today?

Along the way, we tend to discuss things such as forming and maintaining creative communities, methods for making student assessments fairer, increasing students’ visibility and voices within institutions, methods for creating work, differences in approaches to work, and many more subjects. You can explore the website for subjects, disciplines, or people you’re interested in – or just dip in to the latest episode!
